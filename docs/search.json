    "section": "",
    "text": "Born in 1936, Mr. Lee Sangdae has dedicated his life since 1961, at the age of 25, solely for the greater benefit of all nations, ethnicities, and humanity. In an earnest pursuit to rid falsehood, deceit, selfish desires, hatred, and resentment on this planet he embarked on a life of altruism, aiding and uplifting others with sincerity, departing entirely from falsehoods, deceit, and selfish desires. By the age of 30, he was already engaging joyfully in helping and benefiting humanity through the Way of Hongik Ehwa(홍익이화/弘益理化), helping and caring for people. Furthermore, as the pioneer of “Life Mathematics,” a discipline where he merged the truths of his own life into the realm of mathematics, the author envisioned a new world where anyone could elevate their life to a ‘PLUS ZONE’ in an incredibly simple manner. Following the noble intentions and life path set by the author, a group of disciples have arisen, earnestly living the Way of Hongik Ehwa(홍익이화/弘益理化), across diverse fields and professions, reflecting the author’s profound vision and life values.\nEmail: Insaengbooks@gmail.com\nCopyright ⓒ 2024 Higher Consciousness-Working Thinking All rights reserved."
